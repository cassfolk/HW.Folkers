### 2019 average trip duration change by age

When first looking at the data, I could see how outliers existed (duration minutes visual). To combat these, I used a whisker box plot to find the maximum and minimums. The blue box (30-107 min)  holds 50% of the total recorded durations. The whiskers lines ( 1-224 min) are the max and min that disregard any outliers. 

Once the outliers were removed, for the most part, the younger the person the longer the trip average.  1969 is an anomally . There is are over 25k enteries for this age--while the years beside it are more closer to 5k. The only other years to match it in volume are 1987-1989. There seems to be no evidence to expalin why. Personally, I think people enter in the wrong birth year and are actually younger and somewhat immature.


### 2020 COVID impact
Originally my theory was that due to COVID, 2020 would see a vast drop in ridership. The opposite proved to be true. 

Under name, select any station and you will see that the vast majority show higher averages (bottom left) and sum (bottom right) trip durations in 2020. There are a few stations (look at Sip Ave) that have 2019 out perform 2020 in one category, but no  station has 2019 out perform in both. 

You can see from the yearly charts--- 2020 total (top) and station break down (middle)--that there's the expected drop in ridership during the early months of lockdown or panic. However it picks right back up again come summer. 

Consideration:
The duration is based on date the bike is returned. The data is slightly skewed towards the later time and the station it was returned to. I chose to leave them in so that their trip durations would not be lost as this is a review of the whole year's trip durations.

Annomalies:
2020 total (top) -- Spike week Oct 4th. 3 bikes returned after 19, 12, and 11 days--hover over the bar to see details. This causes the largest total minute record. 

Liberty Light Rail's largest spikes in September and October are due to bikes being returned after 22 and 37 days respectively.

### Basic Map
The trend (as clearly seen by the orange popular start/end sites) are all grouped together. 

These points all lie in New Jersey. There are only 51 stations in New Jersey. Their popularity might have to do with their rarity. New York by contrast has 1,238 stations.
